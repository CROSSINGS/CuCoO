# CuCoO: The Cultural Contact Ontology

[![License: CC BY 4.0](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-CC%20BY%204.0-lightgrey.svg)](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/)

A variant of the [Cultural Contact Ontology](http://github.com/paulagranados/CuCoO) that strives to become independent of the historical/cultural context or relevant cultural traits. Context-specific modules can be attached to it and some will be produced as part of this project.

This effort is supported by CROSSINGS (Computational Interoperability For Intangible and Tangible Cultural Heritage). For more information visit [CROSSINGS@EM+](https://www.epfl.ch/labs/emplus/projects/crossings/)
